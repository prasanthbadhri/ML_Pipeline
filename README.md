# ML_Pipeline
A machine learning pipeline makes the code managable and easy.

Pipeline is a end-to-end construction that manages the flow of data. It includes input data, features, machine learning models, model parameters, prediction outputs.
we can Create pipelines for Logistic regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest models etc...
#  Pipeline steps will include
## 1. Data Preprocessing using MinMax Scaler
## 2. Reducing Dimensionality using PCA
## 3. Training respective models
